# Navigating NLP: A Hands-On Approach to Clustering and Classification
**Project Description:**

The project aims to create a personalized food recommendation system by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning. The system generates text-based food recommendations and allows users to customize these recommendations based on their preferences.

The core functionality of the system involves two main components: text generation and user customization. Text generation is achieved through a deep learning model trained on a corpus of food-related text data. This model can generate coherent and contextually relevant food recommendations based on input prompts.

The user customization component allows users to provide their preferences for food items. Users can input a list of preferred food items, and the system will incorporate these preferences into the generated recommendations. This customization enhances the relevance and personalization of the recommendations, ensuring that users receive suggestions tailored to their tastes.
